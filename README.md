# WI_Covid_data_Dec_2020
repository for WI DPH example of Hybrid Shewhart chart functions

I generalized the names of variables used in the Hybrid Shewhart chart files.  In the previous work [IHI_Covid_Public](https://github.com/klittle314/IHI_Covid_Public) many of the names of variables in data frames explicitly referred to DEATHS.  Otherwise, the logic is the same as described in the IHI_Covid_Public [README.md file](https://github.com/klittle314/IHI_Covid_Public/blob/main/README.md)
